### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in London, UK, with experience in a lot of languages (Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Scala, Elixir, C++ and others), but I work mostly with Ruby.
I'm the maintainer of [awesome-rspec](https://github.com/Darhazer/awesome-rspec) and [active_record_change_matchers](https://github.com/Darhazer/active_record_change_matchers), and a core contributor to [rubocop-rspec](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rspec).
