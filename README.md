### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in London, UK, with experience in a lot of languages (Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Scala, Elixir, C++ and others).
I love working on developer tools (and improving developer experience) and I'm member of [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) organization. I'm best known for my contributions to [rubocop-rspec](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-rspec), but I have contributed and will contribute to other rubocop-based projects and generally to other linters. Ocassionaly I fix bugs in whatever software I'm using, regardless of the language.

I'd like to spend more time on open-source. Besides contributing to various developer tools, I'd love to integrate great tools and platforms with Ruby/Rails.

I also have experience with Docker, GitHub actions and various devops tools I've used in various roles.
